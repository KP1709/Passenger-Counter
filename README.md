As an introduction to JavaScript, I went through the first part of the tutorial to build a passenger counter.

## Initial functionalities:  
The original project only had an 'increment' button and a 'save' button which would store and display the value and reset the counter to 0.

## Added functionalities:  
However I adapted the project by adding two extra buttons. One button de-increments the counter and another sets the value back to zero only without saving. A condition was used to make sure the user would stop de-incrementing past zero. This meant I had to adapt each file to add, style and give functionality to the buttons.
